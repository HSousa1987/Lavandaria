## 2025-10-23

### Planned
- [x] Purge legacy Markdown documentation (41 files)
- [x] Bootstrap canonical documentation structure
- [x] Auto-populate database schema using PostgreSQL-RO MCP
- [x] Validate domain terminology using Context7 MCP
- [x] Create living documentation set (architecture, progress, decisions, bugs, security)
- [x] Create README.md as project index
- [x] Full-project sweep: repository baseline, database analysis, E2E testing, security review
- [x] Regenerate CLAUDE.md with Mandatory block

### Doing
- Fixing P0 client photo viewing failure (8/8 tests failing)

### Done
- ✅ **PR #2**: [chore(docs): purge legacy Markdown](https://github.com/HSousa1987/Lavandaria/pull/2)
  - Removed 41 Markdown files (17,904 lines)
  - Complete inventory with rollback instructions
  - Clean slate for curated documentation

- ✅ **Documentation Bootstrap**:
  - Created `docs/` folder structure
  - Generated `docs/architecture.md` with:
    - Live PostgreSQL schema snapshot (15 tables)
    - Validated domain terminology via Context7
    - Business workflow diagrams
    - RBAC permission matrix
    - Migration history
  - Created `docs/progress.md` (this file)
  - Created `docs/decisions.md` with bootstrap decision
  - Created `docs/bugs.md` tracking template
  - Created `docs/security.md` with current posture
  - Created `README.md` project index

- ✅ **MCP Tool Integration**:
  - Connected PostgreSQL-RO MCP server
  - Queried schema for 7 core tables
  - Used Context7 to validate laundry/cleaning terminology
  - Discovered 494 code snippets in Lavandaria project docs

- ✅ **Full-Project Sweep (2025-10-23 PM)**:
  - **Repository Baseline**: Analyzed 4 branches, recent commits, no conflicts
  - **Domain Validation**: Verified workflows via Context7 (494 snippets)
  - **Database Health**: Inspected 15 tables, 150+ constraints, zero critical gaps
  - **E2E Testing**: Executed 37 Playwright tests (8 failures in client-photo-viewing)
  - **Photo Policy**: Confirmed upload limits (10MB, 10/batch), viewing BROKEN
  - **Security Review**: Validated RBAC (7 middleware), SQL injection prevention, rate limiting
  - **Documentation**: Regenerated `CLAUDE.md`, created `FULL_SWEEP_FINDINGS.md`

### Blockers
**P0 CRITICAL**: Client photo viewing completely broken
- 8/8 E2E tests failing in `tests/e2e/client-photo-viewing.spec.js`
- Clients cannot view job photos (core feature non-functional)
- RBAC not enforcing isolation (security risk)
- Viewing tracking not working
- **Blocks production release**

### Notes
- PostgreSQL-RO MCP required connection string parameter (not auto-configured)
- Context7 found our project in its index (/hsousa1987/lavandaria) with 494 snippets
- Validated terminology: laundry lifecycle, cleaning lifecycle, photo types, RBAC patterns
- Split payment tables maintain clean referential integrity (design decision from 2025-10-08)
- **Database Health**: Excellent - all FK constraints, CHECK constraints, proper CASCADE policies
- **Security Posture**: Strong - 100% parameterized queries, HTTP-only cookies, rate limiting
- **Test Coverage**: 37 E2E tests written, 29 passing, 8 failing (all in client-photo-viewing suite)

### Next Steps
- **URGENT**: Fix client photo viewing (P0) - investigate endpoint authentication
- Update `docs/bugs.md` with P0 photo viewing failure
- Create Linear issue for P0 blocker
- Merge `docs/bootstrap` branch to main
- Address P1 security items (HTTPS enforcement, DB user separation)
